# The following mesh_min and mesh_max values are only tested on the 2025.B1
# release using the Stealthburner and Pinda mount from Printables on a MK52
# heated bed. After noting that the stock Prusa MK2/3 firmware only defines
# three bad spots for a whole 7x7 bed probe, these outer bounds were found
# to avoid every single magnet for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 probing. This is done
# at the cost of not probing a big chunk along the left side (where the 
# SuperPINDA can't reach anyway), and a good bit on the right and the top
# of the bed. In return you get a very fast and consistent bed mesh.
